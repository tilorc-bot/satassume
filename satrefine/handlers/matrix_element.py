"""Refine handler for :class:`~sympy.matrices.expressions.matexpr.MatrixElement`.

Extends the vendored ``refine_matrixelement`` with two rules: an element of a
matrix known to be zero is zero, and an off-diagonal element of a matrix known
to be diagonal is zero when the indices are provably distinct.  The vendored
symmetric-index swap is kept by delegating to
:func:`~satrefine._upstream.refine_matrixelement` when neither new rule
applies.

Indices count as provably distinct only when the difference is structurally
nonzero (unequal integer literals, offset indices such as ``i`` and ``i + 1``)
or when ``Q.ne(i, j)`` follows from the assumptions.  Independent symbols are
not distinct: ``X[i, j]`` is on the diagonal when ``i == j``, so no zero can
be proved without an explicit disequality.
